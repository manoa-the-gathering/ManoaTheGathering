		<h3>The Decks</h3>

    At the moment, we only have two decks available: Affinity and Burn. This page will teach you about the two decks, the cards in them, and how to pilot them successfully. Please refer to the cards themselves as well - this is only meant to be a clarification and supplement to the rules written on the cards.<br>
<i class="right arrow icon"></i>
		Your lands produce mana, and may have other effects. You may play one land per turn, during your main phase. Read your lands carefully to make sure you're using them to their full potential.<br>
<i class="right arrow icon"></i>
		Artifacts and creatures (and artifact creatures, which are both) have a casting cost. To play them onto the battlefield, tap your lands to produce mana of the correct color and amount. It's okay if you have too much mana, but try not to be wasteful with it.<br>
<i class="right arrow icon"></i>
		Spells are not permanents - they have an effect, then go into your graveyard. Make sure you target your spells clearly to avoid confusion.<br>
<i class="right arrow icon"></i>
		Your sideboard is the cards you may swap in between games. The first game in any match, you must use only the default cards in your deck. But after you've played a game against an opponent, you can select cards from your sideboard to use instead. Make sure you only have 60 cards when you begin a game, and keep your mana base proportional to the rest of your deck.<br>
<i class="right arrow icon"></i>
    Note: We have omitted a few cards that are simple enough that to explain them would be silly. When in doubt, just read the card.

						Lands
					</div>
					<div class="content">
					<ul>
						<li>Campus Center - this land produces colorless mana. You can use this to pay mana costs which are numbers, not colors. It also can transform into a blinkmoth creature for 1 - make sure if you're going to do this, it isn't tapped. It can also buff blinkmoths, but has to tap to do so, so it's best to do this to other blinkmoths like the IT Center.</li>
            <li>InfoTech Center - this land produces colorless mana. It can also become a blinkmoth for a turn. Pay attention to the <i>infect</i> ability. If a player has 10 poison counters at any time, this causes them to die in the same way that 0 life does, and they lose the game. Creatures with -1/-1 counters keep those counters, and the counters modify their power/toughness. If a creature gets enough minus counters such that their toughness is 0, they die.</li>
            <li>Darksteel Citadel - this land is also an artifact. Note that it is indestructible, meaning that it cannot be destroyed. It can be targeted by "destroy target artifact" effects, but they will not work. It also taps for a colorless mana.</li>
            <li>Diamondhead and Duckpond are basic lands. These tap for their color (red or black, respectively) and do nothing else. You may have as many basic lands in a deck as you want, but we only have a few here because we have enough utility lands to not need more basics.</li>
					</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="title">
						<i class="dropdown icon"></i>
						Artifacts
					</div>
					<div class="content">
          <ul>
            <li>Gate of Hope - this is a legendary card, meaning that you may only have one of it on the field at any given time. It taps for one of any color mana (colorless, white, blue, black, red, or green) but can only be activated if you have 3 or more artifacts on the field.</li>
            <li>Springleaf Drum - tap this and any one creature you control to add any color of mana.</li>
            <li>Cranial plating - this is an equipment, which means you can attach it to a creature to use its ability (an increase of (1*artifacts) of the power of that creature). You can attach it for 1 colorless or two black mana. However, if you use the main "equip" ability, you can only do that as a sorcery. The "two black" cost can be used at any time.</li>
          </ul>
					</div>
					<div class="title">
						<i class="dropdown icon"></i>
						Creatures
					</div>
					<div class="content">
          <ul>
            <li>Etched Luminary - this artifact creature has protection from all colors, which means that any card which has a color cannot affect it. Colorless is <b>not</b> a color.</li>
            <li>Guardian Lion - modular is a keyword used on 0/0 artifact creatures which gives them +1 counters as they enter the battlefield. If all of the counters are removed, even momentarily, they have 0 toughness and die as a state based action. You can add counters to the Lion by sacrificing (killing) your other artifacts.</li>
            <li>Holmes Sculpture - this creature's Battle Cry ability pumps the attack power of other attacking creatures when it attacks. It does not pump itself. It has one-directional flying, which means that it has flying when creatures are blocking it but not for the purpose of it blocking other creatures.</li>
            <li>Spellskite - the activated ability on Spellskite is a magnet. This means that you can pay one blue mana or two life in order to use Spellskite as a magnet for, say, your opponent's kill spell. This only works if Spellskite is a valid target. You cannot choose Spellskite if the effect says "target player".</li>
            <li>Vending Machine - this creature's casting cost is either (1 of anything and 1 black) or (1 of anything and 2 life). Flying means that this creature can only be blocked by creatures with flying or reach, and can block other creatures with flying. It also has lifelink, which means that it heals you for as much damage as it deals. If it deals enough damage to kill a creature (that it's blocking, or that is blocking it, for example) and then some, it still heals you for the full amount that it put out. Since it only has 1 power to start, it must be modified by +1 counters or "until end of turn" effects in order to overkill a creature.</li>

						Spells
					</div>
					<div class="content">
          <ul>
            <li>Chance Meeting - Declare if you have metalcraft (3 or more artifacts) when casting this spell.</li>
          </ul>
					</div>
					<div class="title">
						<i class="dropdown icon"></i>
						Sideboard
					</div>
					<div class="content">
          <ul>
            <li>Ghirapur Aether Grid - We suggest using this on your opponent's end step, right before your untap step. This allows you to get in a point or two of damage if you were not able to attack on your previous turn, or if you didn't need to use mana-generating artifacts. However, it's not necessarily a good idea to use the Grid before then, as you may need the artifacts for their own purposes.</li>
            <li>Bitterblossom - this is not a "may" ability, so you do not have the choice to not use it.</li>
            <li>Chalice of the Void - the casting cost of this artifact is any multiple of 2 mana. It has exactly one half that number of counters on it. If you spend an odd number of mana to cast Chalice, the extra mana is not used. Once the Chalice has entered the battlefield, all spells with CMC equal to the counters on Chalice goes to the graveyard without having an effect. For example, you could cast Chalice for 4 mana of any color. It would enter with 2 counters, and no one could cast any spell which has a CMC of 2. This includes spell with a mana cost of 1 and a color. This would include spells like Vending Machine, since its default cost is 1 of anything and 1 black. Be careful when you cast Chalice, as it will affect you as well. Note that if you need to get rid of it, you can sacrifice it to the Guardian Lion.</li>
            <li>Grafdigger's Cage - this is a hard counter to spells with Flashback (an ability allowing them to be cast from the graveyard). You only want to bring it in against graveyard-heavy decks.</li>
            <li>Ancient Grudge - this is one of those spells with Flashback. You can cast it for one green mana from your graveyard. Make sure not to have the Grafdigger's Cage in your deck at the same time as this, as it will make Ancient Grudge less useful. Remember to exile this card if you cast it with Flashback.</li>
            <li>Thoughtseize - this is good for when you know an opponent has a particular card, or right after the game begins. A nonland card is any card which does not have the land type. Discarded cards go to their owner's graveyard. Note: don't use this if you are low enough on life that you can't afford to lose two.</li>
            <li>Vandalblast - if you cast this for its Overload cost, it still has CMC 1. However, you pay 4 extra mana of any type and destroy all artifacts you don't control. It is still worth casting for the normal cost if you need to get rid of something, but if you have the extra mana and don't need to use it, go ahead and overload.</li>

          <div class="content">
            <ul>
              <li>East-West Road Sign - this is a dual land, meaning that it taps for two colors. You may choose either one of the colors each time you tap it, but not both. This type of dual land is called a "shockland", meaning that it shocks you for two damage if you want it to come in untapped. If not, it enters tapped and cannot be used that turn.</li>
              <li>Japanese Tea Garden, Ka Papa Loi O Kanewai, Stan Sheriff Center - these are another type of dual land, called a "fetchland". It does not tap for mana itself, but instead allows you to search your deck for a basic land of either of two colors. This improves the consistency of your deck and lets you reliably find the colors you need.</li>
              <li>QLC - this is a "tangoland", because you need two other lands already on the field for it to come in untapped.</li>
            </ul>

          <div class="content">
            <ul>
              <li>Campus Catfolk - If you meet both conditions of this card, you get both effects and the Cat has +2/+2. For our purposes, any land which taps for white is a Plains, and any land which taps for red is a Mountain.</li>
              <li>Eidolon of the Great Revel - this affects all players. Make sure you don't need to cast inexpensive spells for a little while after playing this, and if you need to, you may want to let the Eidolon die in battle.</li>
              <li>Goblin Guide - Haste means that this creature is not affected by summoning sickness, so you may want to play it in your first main phase. The second ability is triggered when attacks are declared, so resolve it before the defender declares blockers.</li>
              <li>Grim Technomancer - ALL HAIL PROFESSOR JOHNSON</li>
              <li>Swiftspear - You may want to play this in your first main phase, then cast some other spell if you can to give it +1/+1. For example, if you can cast both this and Lava Spike on turn 2, you can both deal 3 damage directly to them and attack for 2.</li>

          <div class="content">
            <ul>
              <li>Atarka's Command - You may only choose two options from the 4 on this card, and they must be different. Which ones you want to choose will change depending on the situation, but you can usually pick the second one without fear if you only need one of the other effects. Remember that the last ability gives your creatures reach, which means that if you cast it after attackers are declared, you can block fliers.</li>
              <li>Freshman Towers - if someone is controlling a card, they are that card's controller, even if it is a card owned by someone else.</li>
              <li>Rift Bolt - this card's suspend ability can be a little confusing. To use it, cast the card for 1 red mana. The, exile the card. Keep it nearby. At the beginning of your next upkeep, cast the card for free. Your opponent will be able to see it coming, but they may not be able to react anyway. You can also just cast it for 1 red and 2 other mana, if you would like the element of surprise.</li>
              <li>Searing Glass - you must target a creature controlled by the player you are targeting. If that player does not control any creatures, Searing Glass will fail. Keep track of your land drops and try to play your land for the turn before casting this to maximize your damage.</li>

          <div class="content">
            <ul>
              <li>Deflecting Palm - cast this in response to a spell, like you would cast a counterspell, or before combat damage. Make sure to target the source of the damage. If a creature says "this deals damage", the creature is the source. Paying life is not dealing damage, so you cannot avoid the damage from shocklands this way.</li>
              <li>Kor Firewalker - this card has protection from red, which means that red spells cannot target it. Cards which do not target can still affect it, and cards which are partially red count as red.</li>
              <li>Lightning Helix - if the target of the first part of this spell is removed, you don't gain the life.</li>
              <li>Path to Exile - if your opponent can't find a basic land card in their deck, that's okay. They just don't get one, the spell doesn't fizzle.</li>
              <li>Skullcrack - this affects all players. Paying life does not count as damage, so it wouldn't be prevented by damage prevention methods anyway. The 3 damage from this spell cannot be prevented. Use this card to finish off an opponent for the greatest effect.</li>
